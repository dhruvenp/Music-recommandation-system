project name-Music recommandation system
-> here is a python main code 
Read Data and Preprocess it:

The code reads a CSV file containing music data and stores it in a DataFrame df.
It then samples 500 rows from the DataFrame, drops the 'link' column, and resets the index.
The text in the 'text' column is converted to lowercase, and non-alphanumeric characters and newline characters are removed.
Tokenization and Stemming:

The NLTK library is used for tokenization. It downloads the necessary tokenizer if not already present.
The Porter Stemmer is used for stemming, which reduces words to their root form.
A function tokenization is defined, which tokenizes the text and applies stemming to each token.
The tokenization function is then applied to the 'text' column of the DataFrame.
TF-IDF Vectorization:

The TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn is used to convert text data into TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors.
Stop words in English are removed during the vectorization process.
The resulting TF-IDF matrix is stored in the variable matrix.
Compute Cosine Similarity:

Cosine similarity is computed between all pairs of songs based on their TF-IDF vectors.
The resulting similarity matrix is stored in the variable similarity.
Recommendation Function:

The recommendation function takes a song name as input and returns a list of recommended songs.
It first checks if the DataFrame df is not empty.
Then it filters the DataFrame to rows where the 'song' column matches the input song name.
If there are matches, it computes the cosine similarity between the input song and all other songs, sorts them based on similarity, and returns the names of the most similar songs (excluding the input song itself).
If no matches are found, it prints a message indicating that no songs were found matching the input.
If the DataFrame is empty, it prints a message indicating that the DataFrame is empty.
Example Usage:

The recommendation function is called with the input song name "If You Love Me".
The recommended songs are stored in the variable a.
The recommended songs are then printed.
Overall, this code preprocesses music data, computes TF-IDF vectors, calculates cosine similarity between songs, and provides recommendations based on a given input song.
